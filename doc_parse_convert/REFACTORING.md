# Content Extraction Refactoring

## Overview

The original `content_extraction.py` file was refactored into a modular package structure following SOLID principles. This refactoring improves maintainability, readability, and extensibility of the codebase.

## Original Issues

- Monolithic file approaching 2000 lines of code
- Multiple unrelated responsibilities in one file
- Complex interdependencies between classes
- Redundant code patterns
- Difficult to maintain and extend

## New Structure

```
doc_parse_convert/
├── __init__.py              # Package exports
├── config.py                # Configuration classes and constants
├── models/                  # Data models
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── document.py          # Document structure classes
│   └── content.py           # Content representation classes

    ├── image.py             # Image conversion
    └── factory.py           # Factory classes
```

## Benefits

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
3. **Better Organization**: Related code is grouped together logically
4. **Reduced Duplication**: Common patterns are standardized
5. **Simplified Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
6. **Enhanced Extensibility**: New formats can be added without modifying existing code
7. **Clearer Dependencies**: Explicit imports show relationships between components

## Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Factory Pattern**: `ProcessorFactory` creates appropriate processor instances
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different extraction strategies can be selected at runtime
3. **Composition**: Complex objects built from smaller, focused parts
4. **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies passed explicitly rather than created internally

## Specific Improvements

1. **AI Integration**:
   - Extracted prompts into separate module
   - Standardized response schemas
   - Improved error handling and diagnostics

2. **Document Processing**:
   - Clear separation between document types
   - Consistent interface across processors
   - Well-defined extraction strategies

3. **Utility Functions**:
   - Dedicated image conversion utilities
   - Standardized factory methods
   - Better parameter handling

## Next Steps

1. Update tests to use the new structure
2. Add additional documentation
3. Consider further modularization of complex methods
4. Add support for additional document formats (e.g., EPUB)
